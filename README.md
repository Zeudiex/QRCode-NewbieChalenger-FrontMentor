# Frontend Mentor Chalenger

This the Newbie Chalenger of Frontend Mentor.

I did the chalenger with the little knowledge in html and css that i remenber in the moment. So it will be only one prototype. I'm gonna improve this one ever than is possible.

I not too good in english. And i read something in the README-guess(old README) that i have to do something with README-template. But i dedicated a little time to this project.

## About the the project

As you can see, i did all project only in a HTML archive, using INTERNAL CSS.

Have some comments that i have custom to do in some parts of project, only to make some notes.

**I'm gonna do a better README later.**
